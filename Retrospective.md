## Experience
My experience with this project was interesting, especially since I often found some complications with my OCD(Especially with the CSS part), and even tried my luck at animation with keystrokes, which ended up being a bust. Though I did find out how to create something else inside CSS that made the site look more unique and fitting to my own ideas creating a gradient using the Linear-gradient function. I also learned more about formatting in PUG, which was much simpler to me than HTML especially since it felt like the dumbed down version of it in itself though it still took me a second to understand it and get used to the formatting. I also learned more about javascript and after using the code that was given started to understand that there was errors. Whenever I input a task it would go back to the last number plus one and never reset back to one. So I had to problem solve a bit at the end of step 4. Though I managed to figure it out in the end anyway. I also struggled with the idea that I had to basically rewrite my base structure for my index.pug because I had just updated the javascript file.
